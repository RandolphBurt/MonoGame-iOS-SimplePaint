A simple proof of concept app for the iPad.  A 'my first monogame' application.

This demonstrates how easy it is to produce something quickly and easily with monogame.  This is a simple paint app.  You can choose your colour from a pre-set list or define the exact RGBA values by dragging gauges.  Choose your brush size and then just drag your finger around the iPad screen.

In order to build this you will need to also have the MonoGame project (which is here in GitHub) 

Note: At the time of writing this I've only ever run it on the iPad emulator in MonoDevelop.  I've yet to spend the money to allow me to run it on a real iPad, however in theory it should work fine. :-)
